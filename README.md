# Android Units

![App logo](app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png)

Android Units is a powerful unit-aware calculator that can also easily perform simple unit
conversions. It's inspired by GNU Units.

This edition is a continuation of [Steve Pomeroy's original app](https://github.com/xxv/Units).

## Usage

| key |
| --- |
| Anything that is shown within a box can be entered into Units. Eg. `m³÷hr` |

Place the value and the unit you want to convert from in the "you have" box (eg. `4.9inches`) and
the unit you wish to convert to in the "you want" box (eg. `cm`). To enter units, either press the
"unit" button and select from the list, or tap on the input box a second time and an on-screen
keyboard should pop up.

You can enter simple units, such as `cm`/`centimeter` or complex units, such as `m^3÷hr`. You can
press the "unit" button to show a list of all the units. If you don't specify a "to" unit, it will
provide a definition in base units. You can also convert into lists of units, for example `ft; in`.
For a list of examples, please see below.

### Auto-completion

[![](extra/sshot02.thumb.png)](extra/sshot02.png)

Both "you have" and "you want" will auto-complete with all the known units, sorted by usage. The
more you use a given unit, the closer it is to the top of the list. The usage is seeded with initial
usage amounts for common units, including some regional adjustments based on your device's locale.

Units will not start off auto-completing every possible permutation of metric prefix (eg. `deci`,
`centi`, `milli`) with unit name (`meter`, `liter`). Once you make a calculation with a prefix+unit
combination, Units will remember it and auto-complete it from then-on.

### Reciprocal detection

Units will auto-detect instances where you may have forgotten to convert from the reciprocal of a
given value. For instance, if you enter `100mpg` and ask for `liter÷100km`, it will compute it using
the reciprocal of the "from" value (`1÷(100mpg)`) and provide a warning that it used the reciprocal.

### Unit lists

You can convert values into arbitrary lists of units, for example time durations into hours, minutes
and seconds, lengths into foots and inches, or weights into 
[libs and ozzes](https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/03/10). Enter the units separated by a
semicolon (such as `ft; in`), and autocomplete will work as usual. You can also convert into
fractional units like `ft; in; 1|8 in`.

To split up display of the last unit into a decimal and an integer part, add a trailing semicolon.
For rounding the last unit given, add two trailing semicolons.

For example, converting from `42 cm` gives the following results:

| You want   | Result                                             |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `ft; in`   | **1**`ft` + **4.5354331**`in`                      |
| `ft; in;`  | **1**`ft` + **4**`in` + **0.5354331**`in`          |
| `ft; in;;` | **1**`ft` + **5**`in` (rounded up to nearest `in`) |

You can also use the same syntax for rounding single units. For example `3 ft + 7 in` to `cm` will
give **109.22**`cm`, however the same length converted to `cm;;` will result in **109**`cm (rounded
down to nearest cm)`.

To make things easier, Units also includes aliases for a few commonly used unit combinations:

| Alias   | Corresponds to                                                                                   |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hms`   | `hr; min; sec`                                                                                   |
| `time`  | `year; day; hr; min; sec`                                                                        |
| `dms`   | `deg; arcmin; arcsec`                                                                            |
| `ftin`  | `ft; in; 1\|8 in`                                                                                |
| `usvol` | `cup; 3\|4 cup; 2\|3 cup; 1\|2 cup; 1\|3 cup; 1\|4 cup; tbsp; tsp; 1\|2 tsp; 1\|4 tsp; 1\|8 tsp` | 
| `lsd`   | `poundsterling; shilling; oldpence; farthing`                                                    |

### Calculations

[![](extra/sshot01.thumb.png)](extra/sshot01.png)

You can enter complex calculations in both input areas. For example, you can add two conformable
units such as, `2 cm + (4 + (1/2)) in` or multiply  values to higher dimensions, such as,
`3m × 1m × 2cm` to convert to `liter` or `m^3`. You can even convert to an arbitrary complex unit,
provided that everything conforms properly.

## Examples

### Practical conversions

- US→EU height conversion
`5ft + 6in` = **167.64**`cm`
- EU→US height conversion
`180 cm` = **5**`ft` + **10**`in` + **6.9291339** *`1|8in`
- UK→US mass conversion
`13 stone` = **182**`lbs`
- Volume conversion
`10cm×5cm ×3cm` = **0.15**`liter`
- Kitchen: volume to mass
`1cup flour_sifted` = **113.398094**`g`
- Driving: time to distance
`100kph ×5minute` = **5.1780934**`mile`

### Making lemonade, nutritional info

- How much sugar does it have compared to other drinks?
`1cup sugar ÷0.5gallon` = **25.0**`gram ÷8floz`
- What percent juice is it?
`1cup ÷0.5gallon` = **12.5**`percent`

In comparison (per 8 floz), Minute Maid® Lemonade has 3% juice and 27g sugar. Coke has 46g sugar per
8floz.

### Fun conversions

As you can see above, Units knows a number of units that are useful in the kitchen. Most are for
volume↔mass conversion (which can be found under "density"), such as `flour_scooped`, `sugar`, and
`butter`. It also has a few known masses, such as `eggs`, `stickbutter` and `venusmass`.

- Your mass in eggs
`78kg` = **1560**`eggs`
- Time to walk across the U.S. (without sleeping)
`2600mile ÷3mph` = **5**`week` + **1.1111111**`day`
- Time to walk across the U.S. (assuming walking only 8 hours per day)
`2600mile ÷(3mph ×(8hour ÷day))` = **15**`week` + **3.3333333**`day`
- Gasoline efficiency in an alternative unit
`1÷(25mile ÷gallon)` = **79.36508**`microhogshead ÷furlong`

### Science &amp; Physics

- Electricity
`3volt ×150mA` = **0.45**`watt`
- Approximate time it takes light to get from the sun to the Earth.
`sundist ÷c` = **8.316755**`minute`
- EM frequency to wavelength
`light ÷2.417GHz` = **12.403494**`cm`
- using e=mc² to figure out how much energy 1g of matter is equivalent to
`1gram energy` = **21.480764**`kiloton tnt`
